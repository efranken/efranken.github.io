		I started working on this site after seeing <a href="https://www.fabiensanglard.net">Fabien Sanglard's</a> personal website.  The minimalist styling and relatively easy tech used inspired me to create one of my own.
		<br />
		<br />
		From 2013-2021, I was a combo sysadmin/pit crew member for an IndyCar and IMSA team.  My goal was to take the knowledge I gained from the job and move into the DevOps field.  As I started following the <a href="https://www.cloudresumechallenge.dev">cloudresumechallenge.dev</a> outline, I continued work on this site in order to have a place to make a few little articles about what I've worked on.  I have since expanded it to include some other technical projects (personal and professional) that I've worked on.
		<br />
		<br />
		In February 2021, I was able to fulfill my goal of getting a DevOps related job for a large software company in my area.

		<br />
		The layout is all HTML and the styling is all CSS.  There is currently minimal Javascript only on the home page that functions as a view counter.  I will continue writing new articles and improving on the styling and tech used as time goes on.  I likely will not update old articles, unless I make a site-wide change that requires it.
		<br />
		<br />
		Articles will be based around different projects I have worked on, usually mechanical or technical.  Working on mechanical projects helps me think about how I work on technical projects, and vice-versa.
