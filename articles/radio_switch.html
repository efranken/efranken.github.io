    <p class="articleBody">I fulfilled my goal of getting a job in DevOps and leaving racing. I miss racing immensely, but don't miss the stress. Having weekends is great as well. Some of the guys at work have a 24 Hours of LeMons car, which was always a goal of mine to be a part of.<br>
        <br>

        I bought a BaoFeng UV-82 radio for the pits, and wanted to still use the molded earpieces I have from my previous job. The radio came with a PTT speaker mic that also has a mono audio out port. Plugging headphones in outputs audio through both headphones and speakers, which is not ideal.<br>
        <br>
        The solution is to wire a 2 way switch inline of the speaker so I can toggle it on and off, but still be able to use the mic. I was able to implement this with just random parts I had laying around. Parts used were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Random speaker wire</li>
        <li>2 wire switch I found</li>
        <li>Soldering iron/flux/solder</li>
        <li>Heat shrink</li>
        <li>TESA tape</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="articleBody">This mod is as easy as desoldering the positive pin for the speaker and placing this switch in line of it. I cut a part of the rubber at the bottom where the audio port is to fit the wires and used a tywrap to hold it to the coiled cable.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        The PCB can be seen here, and the 2 thicker gauge wires with heatshrink are the ones that I added. The cut I made in the gasket halfway through the middle is also visible.<br>
        <br>
        Congratulations, now you've got toggleable speaker on your speaker mic!<br>
