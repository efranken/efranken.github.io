		I developed the infrastructure the infrastructure for a Selenium grid that:
		<ul>
			<li>Passes 16,000 tests/day</li>
			<li>Cuts yearly infra cost from >$100,000 to around $25,000 </li>
			<li>Dynamically records video of each test case</li>
			<li>Autoscales</li>
			<li>Is fully CI/CD compliant</li>
			<li>Self heals</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="articleBody">
		All without the use of Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to manage the underlying infrastructure (not by choice, but by necessity of the deploy environment.)
		<br />
		<br />
		While developing this, I came across many feature requests on the Selenium GitHub repo for the same features I was developing.  Most of them are likely not within the scope of the Selenium project to make.  
		<br />
		<br />
		I wanted to get the knowledge I had gained out into the open source community, so I submitted a request to give a talk at SeleniumConf.  It was accepted, and I gave my first talk at the global Selenium Conference in late March of 2023.
		<br />
		<br />
		Anyway here's the talk!

		I was also asked to make a video promoting my speech.  
		You already know I had to chef up a little something special for them.
