            &emsp;&emsp; Senior infrastructure and DevOps engineer with 10+ years of experience in designing resilient
            automation platforms, driving org-wide CI/CD adoption, and leading cross-team engineering initiatives across
            Azure and AWS. From the pit lanes of pro motorsport to org-wide enterprise level solutions, I build tools
            and environments that enable low friction adoption of best practices. My focus is creating environments that
            support high-reliability operations. Iâ€™ve led cross-functional platform efforts, defined deployment
            standards adopted company-wide, and mentored engineers in scalable infrastructure design.
