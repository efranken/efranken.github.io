Index generator now runs on a push.  It runs first, then html_tidy workflow runs after.  This requires 2 git pushes as they run on separate containers.  It's obviously more efficient to run this on the same workflow, but I wanted to figure out how to chain workflows.

html_tidy.yml now looks like this at the start:

---
name: html_tidy

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["run_index_generator"]
    types:
      - completed

This index_generator runs and modifies the index, then tidying can commence.

Another interesting consideration is that the container (I'm assuming it's a container at least) that it runs on has python3 by default.
