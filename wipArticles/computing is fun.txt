barries to installing ml libraries

windows hijacked python env var and takes you to app store to download python, making me question if i had it installed before (i did)

windows app store python installs 3.10 alongside the 3.9 that i already had installed

wsl uses a different environment for python, didn't figure out what it is

windows install resets path that pip installs to

this path is not included in the original PATH env var so all commands for individual packages fail

Gym ML library does not support windows?  cannot render?

also does not mention anywhere that it should be used on linux, and is barely supported on windows

jupyter notebook is what a lot of people use, tried it out, still fails because windows base machine

try to run jupyter notebook on WSL, local server is so slow it is unresponsive

try to run a VM on virtualbox, vm startup fails

Disable hyper-v and do the bcdedit thing to keep it from running

start it up, start installing ubuntu

can't install all python packages because disk size is too small

can't expand disk size because not enough space left on my computer

try to resize vdi after making more space, fails
	Resizing to new size 21474836480 is not yet supported for medium 'C:\Users\Erc\VirtualBox VMs\ml\ml.vdi'.

have to make a copy and delete the old one

then reattach the one i just created

try to reinstall

ubuntu does not autoexpand to new size of disk, partition still small

partition can not be resized

the built in tool was likely forcing an align to either a mb or cylinder which threw off the rest of the part when trying to resize

had to download gparted and use the gui to expand while setting align to none

gparted fails unless not set to max

installed on python and ran code, still does not render?

even after I get it running exactly as the youtube video does it the fucker still does not render anything

none of these examples work

they are all out of date, even the ones on the official websites.  Every single one of them has failed.

Every gym example is outdated and still uses v0

Every online example tells you to set "mode="human"" after in env.render()

This has been deprecated, but it won't tell you that it's been deprecated, it just says it doesn't accept it as an argument

You can also set env.render_mode but can't actaully pass a variable to it

it turns out it needs to be set in env=gym.make('env', render_mode="human)
